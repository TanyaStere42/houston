# Wild Me - Houston Backend Server

Houston is a REST API component within the CODEX application suite. It is used to glue the frontend to [Ecological Data Module (EDM)](https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wildbook/tree/next-gen) and [Wildbook-IA](https://github.com/WildMeOrg/wildbook-ia).

For a high-level explanation of the application in relation to other CODEX applications read the documentation at [CODEX - Houston](https://docs.wildme.org/docs/developers/houston).


## About this implementation

This project showcases my vision on how the RESTful API server should be
implemented.

The goals that were achieved in this example:

* RESTful API server should be self-documented using OpenAPI (fka Swagger) specifications, so interactive documentation UI is in place
* Authentication is handled with OAuth2 and using Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (Password Flow) for first-party clients makes it usable not only for third-party "external" apps
* Permissions are handled (and automaticaly documented)
* PATCH method can be handled accordingly to [RFC 6902](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902)
* Extensive testing with good code coverage.

The package Flask-RESTX has been patched (see `flask_restx_patched` folder), so it can handle Marshmallow schemas and Webargs arguments.

## Code Style and Development Guidelines

See [Contributing to Houston](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Project's Code Structure

See [Project Structure](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)

## Installation

### Using docker-compose (recommended)

#### Setup

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/WildMeOrg/houston.git
cd houston
# build the frontend
./scripts/build.frontend.sh
cd deploy/codex
docker-compose up
```

Surf to http://localhost:84/

#### Developer Usage Note

To use the docker setup as a development environment:

```bash
docker-compose exec houston /bin/bash
```

This will give you a bash shell prompt within the container that is currently running houston. You can do any operation mentioned in this document within this shell (e.g. `pytest`).

### Installing from source

#### Clone the Project

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/WildMeOrg/houston.git
cd houston/
```

#### Setup Environment

It is recommended to use virtualenv or Anaconda/Miniconda to manage Python
dependencies. Please, learn details yourself.
For quickstart purposes the following will set up a virtualenv for you:

```bash
./scripts/venv.sh
source virtualenv/houston3.7/bin/activate

# To add bash-completion
export SCRIPT="$(pwd)/.invoke-completion.sh"
invoke --print-completion-script bash > $SCRIPT
echo "source $SCRIPT" >> virtualenv/houston3.7/bin/activate
```

Set up and install the package:

```bash
tar -zxvf _db.initial.tar.gz
pip install -e .
invoke app.dependencies.install
./scripts/build.frontend.sh
```

#### Run Server

NOTE: All dependencies and database migrations will be automatically handled,
so go ahead and turn the server ON! (Read more details on this in Tips section)

```bash
$ invoke app.run
```

#### Deploy Server

In general, you deploy this app as any other Flask/WSGI application. There are
a few basic deployment strategies documented in the [`./deploy/`](./deploy/)
folder.


## Usage

Open online interactive API documentation:
[http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/)

Autogenerated swagger config is always available from
[http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/swagger.json](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/swagger.json)

`example.db` (SQLite) includes 2 users:

* Admin user `root` with password `q`
* Regular user `user` with password `w`

NOTE: Use On/Off switch in documentation to sign in.

I use [`pyinvoke`](http://pyinvoke.org) with custom tasks to maintain easy and
nice command-line interface. Thus, it is required to have `invoke` Python
package installed, and optionally you may want to install `colorlog`, so your
life become colorful.

Quickstart
----------

Open online interactive API documentation:
[http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/)

Autogenerated swagger config is always available from

Authentication Details
----------------------

This example server features OAuth2 Authentication protocol support, but don't
be afraid of it! If you learn it, OAuth2 will save you from a lot of troubles.

### Authentication with Login and Password (Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant)

Here is how you authenticate with user login and password credentials using cURL:

```
$ curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/oauth2/token?grant_type=password&client_id=documentation&username=root&password=q'
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "access_token": "oqvUpO4aKg5KgYK2EUY2HPsbOlAyEZ",
    "refresh_token": "3UTjLPlnomJPx5FvgsC2wS7GfVNrfH",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "scope": "auth:read auth:write users:read users:write teams:read teams:write"
}
```

That is it!

Well, the above request uses query parameters to pass client ID, user login and
password which is not recommended (even discouraged) for production use since
most of the web servers logs the requested URLs in plain text and we don't want
to leak sensitive data this way.  Thus, in practice you would use form
parameters to pass credentials:

```
$ curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/oauth2/token?grant_type=password' -F 'client_id=documentation' -F 'username=root' -F 'password=q'
```

, or even pass `client_id` as Basic HTTP Auth:

```
$ curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/oauth2/token?grant_type=password' --user 'documentation:' -F 'username=root' -F 'password=q'
```

You grab the `access_token` and put it into `Authorization` header
to request "protected" resources:

```
$ curl --header 'Authorization: Bearer oqvUpO4aKg5KgYK2EUY2HPsbOlAyEZ' 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/users/me'
{
    "id": 1,
    "username": "root",
    "email": "root@localhost",
    "first_name": "",
    "middle_name": "",
    "last_name": "",
    "is_active": true,
    "is_regular_user": true,
    "is_admin": true,
    "created": "2016-10-20T14:00:35.912576+00:00",
    "updated": "2016-10-20T14:00:35.912602+00:00"
}
```

Once the access token expires, you can refresh it with `refresh_token`. To do
that, OAuth2 RFC defines Refresh Token Flow (notice that there is no need to
store user credentials to do the refresh procedure):

```
$ curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/oauth2/token?grant_type=refresh_token' --user 'documentation:' -F 'refresh_token=3UTjLPlnomJPx5FvgsC2wS7GfVNrfH'
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "access_token": "FwaS90XWwBpM1sLeAytaGGTubhHaok",
    "refresh_token": "YD5Rc1FojKX1ZY9vltMSnFxhm9qpbb",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "scope": "auth:read auth:write users:read users:write teams:read teams:write"
}
```

### Authentication with Client ID and Secret (Client Credentials Grant)

Here is how you authenticate with user login and password credentials using cURL:

```
$ curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/oauth2/token?grant_type=client_credentials' --user 'documentation:KQ()SWK)SQK)QWSKQW(SKQ)S(QWSQW(SJ*HQ&HQW*SQ*^SSQWSGQSG'
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "access_token": "oqvUpO4aKg5KgYK2EUY2HPsbOlAyEZ",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "scope": "teams:read users:read users:write teams:write"
}
```

The same way as in the previous section, you can grab the `access_token` and
access protected resources.


API Integration
---------------

One of the key point of using OpenAPI (Swagger) specification is that it
enables automatic code generation.
[Swagger Codegen project](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)
implements client library and server stub generators for over 18
programming languages! There are also many other projects with OpenAPI
specification support, so if you lack anything in the official tooling,
search for third-party solutions.

I have had a need to work with my API servers from Python and JavaScript, so
I started with Swagger Codegen Python and JavaScript generators. Very soon I
realized that most (if not all) Swagger Codegen generators lack OAuth2 support,
but other than that, the client libraries look fine (I have contributed a few
changes to Python and JavaScript generators over the time, and the nice thing
all the clients benefit from contributions into a single project). Thus,
@khorolets and I implemented hacky OAuth2 support for Python client and even
more hacky out-of-client helpers for JavaScript (hopefully, one day OAuth2
support will be contributed into the Swagger Codegen upstream).

To use Swagger Codegen, you only need a `swagger.json` file describing your API
server. You can get one by accessing http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/swagger.json,
or by running an Invoke task:

```bash
$ invoke app.swagger
```

NOTE: Use stdout rediction to save the output into a file.

To further simplify the codegeneration, there is another Invoke task:

```bash
$ invoke app.swagger.codegen --language python --version 1.0.0
```

To run that, however, you will need Docker installed on your machine since we
use Swagger Codegen as a Docker image. Once that is completed, you will have a
Python client in the `clients/python/dist/` folder. The `javascript` client can
be generated just the same way. Read the generated `clients/*/dist/README.md`
to learn how to use those clients.

NOTE: As mentioned above, a slightly modified Swagger Codegen version is used
to enable OAuth2 support in Python client.


Integrations with Flask-* Projects
----------------------------------

Since this project is only an extension to Flask, most (if not all) Flask
plugins should work.

Verified compatible projects:
* flask-sqlalchemy
* flask-login
* flask-marshmallow
* flask-oauthlib
* flask-cors
* flask-limiter

### Example integration steps

#### flask-limiter

1. Add `flask-limiter` to end of the `app/requirements.txt` file, so it gets
installed when the application is deployed.
2. Apply the relevant changes to `app/extensions/__init__.py`:

    ```python
    # ... other imports.

    from flask_limiter import Limiter
    from flask_limiter.util import get_remote_address

    # change limiter configs per your project needs.
    limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address, default_limits=["1 per minute"])

    from . import api

    def init_app(app):
        """
        Application extensions initialization.
        """
        for extension in (
                # ... other extensions.
                limiter,  # Add this
            ):
            extension.init_app(app)
    ```
3. (Optional) Set endpoint-specific limits:

    ```python
    from app.extensions import limiter

    @api.route('/account/verify')
    class IdentityVerify(Resource):
        """
        Handle identity verification.
        """
        # Notice this is different from the simple example at the top of flask-limiter doc page.
        # The reason is explained here: https://flask-limiter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#using-flask-pluggable-views
        decorators = [limiter.limit("10/second")] # config as you need.

        @api.parameters(parameters.SomeParameters())
        @api.response(schemas.SomeSchema())
        def post(self, args):
            return {"verified": True}
    ```


Tips
----

Once you have invoke, you can learn all available commands related to this
project from:

```bash
$ invoke --list
```

Learn more about each command with the following syntax:

```bash
$ invoke --help <task>
```

For example:

```bash
$ invoke --help app.run
Usage: inv[oke] [--core-opts] app.run [--options] [other tasks here ...]

Docstring:
  Run DDOTS RESTful API Server.

Options:
  -d, --[no-]development
  -h STRING, --host=STRING
  -i, --[no-]install-dependencies
  -p, --port
  -u, --[no-]upgrade-db
```

Use the following command to enter ipython shell (`ipython` must be installed):

```bash
$ invoke app.env.enter
```

`app.run` and `app.env.enter` tasks automatically prepare all dependencies
(using `pip install`) and migrate database schema to the latest version.

Database schema migration is handled via `app.db.*` tasks group. The most
common migration commands are `app.db.upgrade` (it is automatically run on
`app.run`), and `app.db.migrate` (creates a new migration).

You can use [`better_exceptions`](https://github.com/Qix-/better-exceptions)
package to enable detailed tracebacks. Just add `better_exceptions` to the
`app/requirements.txt` and `import better_exceptions` in the `app/__init__.py`.


Marshmallow Tricks
------------------

There are a few helpers already available in the `flask_restx_patched`:

* `flask_restx_patched.parameters.Parameters` - base class, which is a thin
  wrapper on top of Marshmallow Schema.
* `flask_restx_patched.parameters.PostFormParameters` - a helper class,
  which automatically mark all the fields that has no explicitly defined
  location to be form data parameters.
* `flask_restx_patched.parameters.PatchJSONParameters` - a helper class for
  the common use-case of [RFC 6902](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902)
  describing JSON PATCH.
* `flask_restx_patched.namespace.Namespace.parameters` - a helper decorator,
  which automatically handles and documents the passed `Parameters`.

You can find the examples of the usage throughout the code base (in
`/app/modules/*`).


### JSON Parameters

While there is an implementation for JSON PATCH Parameters, there are other
use-cases, where you may need to handle JSON as input parameters. Naturally,
JSON input is just a form data body text which is treated as JSON on a server
side, so you only need define a single variable called `body` with
`location='json'`:

```python
class UserSchema(Schema):
    id = base_fields.Integer(required=False)
    username = base_fields.String(required=True)


class MyObjectSchema(Schema):
    id = base_fields.Integer(required=True)
    priority = base_fields.String(required=True)
    owner = base_fields.Nested(UserSchema, required=False)


class CreateMyObjectParameters(Parameters):
    body = base_fields.Nested(MyObjectSchema, location='json', required=True)


api = Namespace('my-objects-controller', description="My Objects Controller", path='/my-objects')


@api.route('/')
class MyObjects(Resource):
    """
    Manipulations with My Objects.
    """

    @api.parameters(CreateMyObjectParameters())
    @api.response(MyObjectSchema())
    @api.response(code=HTTPStatus.CONFLICT)
    @api.doc(id='create_my_object')
    def post(self, args):
        """
        Create a new My Object.
        """
        return create_my_object(args)
```

How to Update Schemas / Create a Migration
============
1. Update schema objects in `/app/modules`
2. Run `invoke app.db.migrate` to create an auto generated migration or `invoke app.db.revision` to create an empty migration for non-schema updates
3. A new file should have been created in `/app/migrations/versions`
4. Run `invoke app.db.upgrade`

RFC 6902 Compliance
============
This implementation is compatible with RFC6509 with the exception that for removal of list items via patch. This implementation supports an optional value in the patch removal operation to permit deletion of associations between modules.
